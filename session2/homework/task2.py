# Task 2: Character Type Identifier
# Ask the user to input a single character. Determine and print:
# "It's a digit" if the character is a number (0-9).
# "It's a letter" if the character is a letter (a-z, A-Z).
# "It's a special character" otherwise.


# single_ch = input("please input single character:")


# if single_ch=="a-z":
#     print("It's a letter")
# elif single_ch=="!@#$$%^^&**()":
#     print("It's a special character")
# else:
#     print("It's a digit")
